Notes:,1. Measured with a h.a.l.m. flash solar simulator ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2. Because of equipment limitations the maximum temperature for measurements was 65⁰C instead of 75⁰C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"3. Measurements for 15⁰C and irradiances of 400, 600, 800, and 1000 W/m2 were not performed because of equipment limitations and infrequent occurrence of those conditions at the Cocoa, Eugene, and Golden sites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"4. Raw Isc and Imp data corrected for temperature and irradiance using equation 1 of  IEC 60891, raw Voc and Vmp corrected for temperature",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"5. Uncertainty for crystalline silicon modules: Pm = ± 2.8%,  Isc = ± 2.3%, Imp = ± 2.3%, Voc = ± 0.3%, Vmp = ± 0.7%",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"6. At 15°C, measured only with forward I-V curve and not reverse sweep, which may have underestimated performance for this module with high capacitance. Only forward sweep was used because the module was in a transient state having come out of climate chamber and was warming to ambient temperature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
